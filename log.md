| Week      | Summary                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Oct <br/> 7-11  | We began to migrate our new project to GitHub. |
| Oct <br/> 14-18 | Amara put finishing touches on our project proposal while Barrett prepared to order parts on Friday. |
| Oct <br/> 21-25 | We finalized our parts list and ordered them. More information was added to the project proposal. |
| Oct <br/> 28-31 | Work was put into organizing the GitHub repository and Google Drive folder. A slack channel was created for the project as well. |
| Nov <br/> 6-8 | We spent our three-day week building a small oscillator from parts found around the lab. We will test it next week. |
| Nov <br/> 11-15 | Barrett took some time to familiarize himself with Processing and an audio analysis library. Amara worked on CAD models for the instrument case. |
| Dec <br/> 2-6 | A lot of organization work was done this week. We created most of our midterm presentation and then cleaned up our GitHub repo and started designing a shelf system for our boxes to create space for more parts. |
| Jan <br/> 6-10 | We began building prototype circuits on breadboards. Amara worked on the variable pitch oscillator and Barrett worked on the power supply. |
| Jan <br/> 13-17 | We spent this week trying to get a consistent sinusoidal output from our variable pitch oscillator circuit. More work needs to be done. |
| Jan <br/> 20-24 | Amara used a circuit simulation program to simulate our oscillator and see how we can get it to provide a consistent output. Barrett got some wiring work done and looked to see where we could order some transistors we seem to be missing. |
| Jan <br/> 27-31 | Barrett completed the fixed pitch oscillator prototype that we will test next week. Amara discovered that we were not testing our oscillators with a true direct current so she found a power supply that will hopefully provide more accurate results. |
| Feb <br/> 3-7 | With a consistent power supply, Amara was able to complete the variable pitch oscillator and produce a sinusoidal output. We will move on to the fixed pitch oscillator next week. |
| Feb <br/> 17-21 | We started building our own power supply circuit this week but after a few complications and missing parts we found a power supply in an old computer that fit our needs perfectly. Next week we will begin migrating our circuits to the large Makeronics breadboard we ordered and work on the amplifier circuit as well. |
| Feb <br/> 24-28 | Amara began the process of moving our prototype modules to a single large breadboard. Barrett printed a new shelf for his box and added some information to our final report. |
| Mar <br/> 2-6 | We identified the resistors that we don't have in the Sigma Lab and looked into getting them ordered. We continued our tasks from last week. |
