| Week      | Summary                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Oct <br/> 7-11  | We began to migrate our new project to GitHub. |
| Oct <br/> 14-18 | Amara put finishing touches on our project proposal while Barrett prepared to order parts on Friday. |
| Oct <br/> 21-25 | We finalized our parts list and ordered them. More information was added to the project proposal. |
| Oct <br/> 28-31 | Work was put into organizing the GitHub repository and Google Drive folder. A slack channel was created for the project as well. |
| Nov <br/> 6-8 | We spent our three-day week building a small oscillator from parts found around the lab. We will test it next week. |
| Nov <br/> 11-15 | Barrett took some time to familiarize himself with Processing and an audio analysis library. Amara worked on CAD models for the instrument case. |
| Dec <br/> 2-6 | A lot of organization work was done this week. We created most of our midterm presentation and then cleaned up our GitHub repo and started designing a shelf system for our boxes to create space for more parts. |
| Jan <br/> 6-10 | We began building prototype circuits on breadboards. Amara worked on the variable pitch oscillator and Barrett worked on the power supply. |
| Jan <br/> 13-17 | We spent this week trying to get a consistent sinusoidal output from our variable pitch oscillator circuit. More work needs to be done. |
| Jan <br/> 20-24 | Amara used a circuit simulation program to simulate our oscillator and see how we can get it to provide a consistent output. Barrett got some wiring work done and looked to see where we could order some transistors we seem to be missing. |
