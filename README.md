# Building a Theremin
We are building a theremin for our Engineering Capstone project. test test

## Summary
The goal of this project is to research the science behind the theremin, an electronic instrument that uses two antennas to produce a controllable sound signal. By the end of the school year we will have a working instrument and hopefully the skill to make music with it as well.

In order to achieve a fully functional product in the time provided, we will need to plan out the entire process step by step:

* Research

  We have very little knowledge about how theremins produce sound so we will have to take the time to learn before beginning work. The theremin community is very strong; many others have gone through the process of building their own theremins and their processes are well documented online. 
  
* Design

  There is some amount of risk with this project. we will be building a fairly large device with many specialized electronic parts, meaning that mistakes in the design process can be expensive and time consuming. we will take the time to consider how each part works within the assembly and make sure every part we order will work as intended.
